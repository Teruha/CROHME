CROHME formula training set (modified 2014/2016 train set)
R. Zanibbi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a modified version of the CROHME 2014/2016 training set formulas.
There are three versions of ground truth here:

	1. inkml/ - contains all stroke + MathML data in CROHME InkML format
	2. lg/ - contains stroke segments (symbols) and symbols labels + 
	         Symbol Layout Tree (or 'SRT') edges.
	3. lg_norel/ - **for Project 2,** this version of .lg ground truth
			 contains only the symbol data (relations are removed).

For Project 2, you will need to read stroke data from the inkml files 
(e.g., using BeautifulSoup), and then produce .lg output. For evaluation
and training, you should use the .lg files in the lg_norel directory, to
avoid confusing metrics.

For Project 3, you will want to use the .lg files in the lg/ directory, 
which contain both symbol and spatial relationship information.

NOTE:

Make sure to have a look at the README for LgEval and CROHMELib (but 
especially LgEval) to get a summary of the tools available.

NOTE 2:

Apparently one .inkml file was empty; I have left this (along with the
warning message in this directory) so that the data set remains the same
as that used in the published competition results.
